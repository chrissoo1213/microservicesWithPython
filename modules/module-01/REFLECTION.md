# Module 1 — Reflection

Answer the three questions below. There are no right or wrong answers — we are looking for your reasoning, not a textbook definition. A few honest sentences are worth more than a long generic paragraph.

---

## 1. The "why"

You started from a painful monolith. Now you're splitting it into separate services.

**What concrete problem does that split solve: and for whom?**

Think about it from three angles: the developer who has to change code, the team that has to deploy it, and the user who has to live with its failures. You don't need to cover all three, pick the one that felt most real to you today.

> _Your answer:_
Splitting the monolith into microservices makes the system easier to maintain and deploy. Developers can work on one service without affecting the whole application, and if one service crashes the entire platform does not necessarily go down.
---

## 2. Your choice

Look at your service map. Every arrow between two services is a decision someone made.

**Pick one boundary, one place where you decided service A should not be part of service B. Explain why that line exists.**

What would break, slow down, or become harder to manage if you merged those two services back together?

> _Your answer:_
I separated notification-service from activity-service because notifications can become heavy under high traffic. If both were merged together, notification issues could slow down or block activity logging for users.

## 3. The tradeoff

Microservices solve the monolith's problems. But they create new ones.

**Name one thing that was simpler in the monolith and is now harder in your distributed design.**

No need to solve it: just name it honestly. This is exactly the tension the rest of the course is about.

> _Your answer:_
The monolith was simpler because everything was in one project and one database. With microservices, communication between services, debugging, deployment, and infrastructure become more complicated.
